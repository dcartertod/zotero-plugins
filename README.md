Terrifically small pieces of functionality. Just playing around and solving my own problems.

ZoteroPreview
===============

This open source project is for adding a Preview tab with a citation preview for a particular item in Zotero (next to the "Related" tab) using your chosen bibliographic style.

## Installing

Zotero Abstract Cleaner
=======================

This project is for fixing line endings in abstracts in Zotero, for example, after copying and pasting from Adobe Acrobat. It adds a menu item in the right-click contextual menu for items. This means that you can select multiple items and apply this function to all of them.
