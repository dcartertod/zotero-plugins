# zotero-plugins
Terrifically small pieces of functionality. Just playing around and solving my own problems. Also, never really used Github before!

ZoteroPreview
===============

This project adds a Preview tab with a citation preview for a particular item in Zotero (next to the "Related" tab) using your chosen bibliographic style.

[Download ZoteroPreview](https://github.com/dcartertod/zotero-plugins/releases/download/0.1.6/ZoteroPreview.xpi)

## Installing

To install ZoteroPreview, download the latest version of ZoteroPreview.xpi from this GitHub repo. In **Zotero** , open Tools -> Add-ons. Then from the cogwheel, choose "Install add-on from File..".


Zotero Abstract Cleaner
=======================

This project is for fixing line endings in abstracts in Zotero, for example, after copying and pasting from Adobe Acrobat. It adds a menu item in the right-click contextual menu for items called "Fix Line Endings in Abstract". This means that you can select multiple items and apply this function to all of them.
