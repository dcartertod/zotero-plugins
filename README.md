Terrifically small pieces of functionality. Just playing around and solving my own problems.

Zotero Abstract Cleaner
=======================

This project is for fixing line endings in abstracts in Zotero, for example, after copying and pasting from Adobe Acrobat. It adds a menu item in the right-click contextual menu for items. This means that you can select multiple items and apply this function to all of them.

# Installing

To install Zotero Abstract Cleaner, download ZoteroAbstractCleaner.xpi from this GitHub repo. In **Zotero** , open Tools -> Add-ons. Then from the cogwheel choose "Install add-on from File..".
